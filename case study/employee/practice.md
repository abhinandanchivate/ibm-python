### üìò **Case Study: eCommerce Database System**

Your eCommerce system manages:

| Entity        | Attributes                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer      | `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `created_at`                   |
| Product       | `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `stock`, `category`                 |
| Order         | `id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `status`, `total_amount`               |
| OrderItem     | `id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `unit_price`                  |
| Payment       | `id`, `order_id`, `payment_mode`, `amount_paid`, `payment_status`, `paid_on` |

- A **Customer** can place multiple **Orders**
- An **Order** can have multiple **OrderItems**
- **OrderItem** maps a **Product** to an **Order**
- **Payment** is made **per Order**
