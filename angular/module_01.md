## ✏️ Module 1: Angular Setup & Fundamentals

### 📁 Project Structure (Typical Enterprise Layout):

```
angular-enterprise/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── core/                     # Core services, interceptors, guards
│   │   ├── shared/                   # Shared components, directives, pipes
│   │   ├── features/                 # Feature-specific modules
│   │   │   ├── user/
│   │   │   └── dashboard/
│   │   ├── app-routing.module.ts     # Central routing config
│   │   ├── app.component.ts/html/scss
│   │   └── app.module.ts             # Root module
│   ├── assets/                       # Images, icons, etc.
│   ├── environments/                 # environment.ts and environment.prod.ts
├── angular.json                      # CLI config
├── package.json                      # Dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json                     # TypeScript config
```

* `core/`: Singleton services (Auth, API), guards, interceptors.
* `shared/`: Common components (buttons, modals), directives, pipes.
* `features/`: Feature-based modules for scalability (e.g., user, admin).
* `app-routing.module.ts`: Defines top-level navigation.
* `assets/`: Static files (images, JSON mocks).
* `environments/`: Environment-based configuration toggles.

This structure enforces **separation of concerns**, **modular development**, and **enterprise readiness**.

### 📚 Concepts and Definitions:

* **Angular CLI**:
  A command-line interface tool that simplifies creation, configuration, and management of Angular apps.

* **Project Structure**:
  Organized layout to separate UI, logic, assets, and configurations, improving team productivity and codebase scalability.

* **AppModule**:
  The root NgModule that wires together the application's main building blocks and bootstraps the root component.

* **main.ts**:
  The true entry point of every Angular app. It launches the app by bootstrapping the `AppModule`.

---

### 🧱 Where It Fits in Angular Architecture:

This module builds the **foundation of every Angular application**. It defines:

* App startup flow (`main.ts` → `AppModule`)
* High-level module separation
* Project configuration and environment separation

Without this base, further modules (routing, DI, forms, etc.) cannot function correctly.

---

### 🛠️ Practical Setup Steps:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new angular-enterprise --routing --style=scss
cd angular-enterprise
ng serve
```

* `--routing` adds a preconfigured `AppRoutingModule`
* `--style=scss` enables Sass support
* `ng serve` starts the local development server

---

### ✅ Best Practices:

* Always use `--strict` flag during project generation for enhanced type safety.
* Modularize early using `core`, `shared`, and `features`.
* Keep `AppModule` lean—delegate features to feature modules.
* Use `environments` for all API URLs and build-time toggles.

---

### ❌ Common Pitfalls:

* Skipping routing during CLI setup and manually patching later.
* Overloading `AppComponent` with feature logic.
* Using a flat folder structure in large-scale apps.
* Hardcoding environment-specific logic instead of using `environment.ts`.
